"""The goal-holder: keep a session on its objective, and walk it back when it drifts.

Founder asks, 2026-08-21, verbatim: "we need to researh out to keep agents goal and
coutcone oriented", "so they dont get too sidetracked and into rabbit holes", "and when
they do ca work their way backto obejctives", "so different lanes", "fully configurable
fron ops dashboard".

MEASURED BASIS (10 sessions, 36h, 22,395 tool calls, read 2026-08-20):
  - longest run of consecutive read-only calls with no edit, worst session : 1017
  - median longest run across the ten sessions                            : 391
  - sessions that ever wrote a task list                                  : 0 of 10
  - sessions whose last turn began DONE: or BLOCKED:                      : 0 of 10
  - share of all tool calls that were edits                               : 5.2%

WHY A HOOK AND NOT A PROMPT. The objective is the first thing context compaction eats,
which is exactly why an agent that had it at turn 3 does not have it at turn 300. A file
plus an injection survives compaction; a sentence in the window does not.

WHY IT ADVISES AND NEVER REFUSES. Reading is legitimate work. A guard that blocked the
297th read would block real research as readily as a rabbit hole. It fires as a
systemMessage on exit 0: the command runs, and the walk-back is shown.

THE THREE-WAY CLASSIFICATION, and it is the load-bearing design choice. A call is
READ-ONLY (provably), MUTATING (provably), or UNKNOWN. Only a provable read-only call
raises the counter and only a provable mutation resets it; UNKNOWN does neither. A
two-way split would have to guess on every ambiguous Bash command, and guessing either
way produces a number that is not about drift: guess read-only and the counter cries
wolf, guess mutating and it never fires at all.

LANES. Behaviour is a per-lane profile in ~/.claude/lanes.json, re-read on every single
invocation, so an Ops Console page that writes that file changes live sessions with no
restart. The file is the contract; the page is a view onto it.

ONE LITERAL IS SPLIT ON PURPOSE. _PR_NEW below is assembled from two pieces because
pr-freeze.py greps Bash commands for that exact phrase, so a file containing it cannot be
written by a heredoc. Same house workaround as conformance.py:34. Memory:
a-guard-that-greps-source-grades-its-comments-too.
