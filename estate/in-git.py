"""Everything load-bearing is in git, or this exits 1 (LAW 24).

Six classes, because answering the question for one of them and calling it
closed is how the last four holes survived:

  runners   every program a launchd job executes
  declared  the laws, settings, agent definitions, skills, job definitions
  repos     every estate repo clean and pushed, not just committed locally
  mirrors   the live copy and the committed copy still identical
  secrets   a credential file has a committed example naming its keys, and the
            values are still absent from the repo (LAW 21 outranks LAW 24)
  offsite   every repo has a recent, verified bundle off this machine, because
            "it is on GitHub" is one suspended account away from being wrong

What it is NOT allowed to do is pass because it did not look. Every class that
cannot run reports UNKNOWN and fails the sweep, never a quiet zero.

    Five of the six classes read this machine: launchd jobs, live checkouts, the

      * a declaration naming a repo copy that nobody committed, which is how a
        mirror entry silently stops mirroring anything;
      * an example file that carries a value, which is LAW 21 breached in git
